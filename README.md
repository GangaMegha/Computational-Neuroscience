# Computational-Neuroscience
Repository contains python as well as MATLAB codes used to get a better understanding about the functioning of network of neurons in the brain.

### CNN
The network comprises of a convolutional layer as well as a fully connected layer, used as a classifier for MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
Main code for training : "Traincnn.m"
The network is saved as CNN_Network.
"visualise.m" loads the saved network and saves the visualised filters as both grey scale and a colour map.
The analysis of the network, results and inferences can be found in "Report.pdf"
The dataset can be downloaded from : http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
